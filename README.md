# Lab Classes - Inheritance Project

This project extends the basic LabClass from Chapter 1 by introducing an `Instructor` class that shares a common `Person` superclass with `Student`.

## Features
- Inheritance between `Person`, `Student`, and `Instructor`
- A `LabClass` can now store many students and one instructor
- Shared methods and cleaner class design

## Classes
- `Person` – base class with name and email
- `Student` – extends `Person`, adds student ID
- `Instructor` – extends `Person`, adds office
- `LabClass` – manages students and instructor
